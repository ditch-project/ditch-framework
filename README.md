# ditch-framework
a simple java gui framework, element oriented, targeted to beginners who wants to see a window, not command prompt.

## concept
when i was in the shower earlier, i thought to myself,

"*why the hell* are java gui libraries confusing?"

i've been getting into c#, and stumbled upon **osu-framework** which is some sort of holy creation that osu devs use for their own game, *osu*.  so now, ive been thinking to myself, why doesn't java have libraries like these(~~exclude the fact that this is an old, slower, backend language~~)?  thus born, **ditch-framework**, a simple gui library targetted to beginner java programmers, who don't want to see that command prompt thingy, but also don't want to learn how to (*gasp*) do javafx or some funky stuff like that.
